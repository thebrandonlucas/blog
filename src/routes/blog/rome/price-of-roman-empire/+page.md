  <title>The Roman Empire was Sold at a Public Auction</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The Roman Empire was the most expansive empire in history, encompassing most of the known world at its height. And yet, near its height, the mighty empire was sold for public auction by it's highest ranking military branch: the Praetorian Guards." />

I'm currently reading _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ by Edward Gibbon, and just finished a part that absolutely blew my mind. I felt compelled to write about it because it's a history I didn't know, which I was very _surprised to learn_ I didn't know. In A.D. 180, Commodus became sole emperor of Rome. His father, Marcus Aurelius, probably one of the best leaders in human history, had just died. Commodus turned out to be unlike his father in almost every way, and was probably one of the _worst_ leaders in human history. After his sister (among others) made a failed assassination attempt on his life, his reign became a cesspool of intrigue and pathetic despotism. He debased the currency, had anyone he didn't like killed (which included well-respected senators, generals, and old friends of his father), and created a cult of personality by performing as a (cheating and petty) gladiator in the Colosseum. Not to mention, he had no interest in actually running the empire, which he left to his more able but equally pernicious subordinates. Cassius Dio, a senator at the time who witnessed his many antics firsthand, said that his reign marked Rome's descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust", which turned out to be prescient.

Commodus ended up being strangled to death by another gladiator named Narcissus, naked and drunk, in his bathtub. A fittingly pathetic end to a pathetic character.

The man who succeeded him as emperor was very different, and for a moment there was a hope of Rome returning to its former glory. The Praetorians went to an older senator with exceptional accomplishments who still upheld Marcus Aurelius' ideals. The son of a freed slave, Pertinax had worked his way up through Roman society by his leadership abilities. He retained a modesty and ethic that was thought would undo much of the mess left by Commodus. When the Praetorians came to his house to inform him of their choice of him as senator, he was unaware that Commodus was dead. He knew he was one of the senators who would eventually incur Commodus' suspicious wrath, as he was one of the last senators from Marcus Aurelius' generation. So, when the guards showed up at his door, he received them at his house with resignation, and accepted that his time had finally come. He was surprised to learn that they had come not to execute him, but to make him _emperor_.

Pertinax's reign was much more in line with the principles of Marcus Aurelius, and he was humble, self-effacing, and generous. He made one fatal flaw, albeit done with noble intentions, that proved murderous to him. He tried to restore discipline to the Praetorian guards. Since these were the emperor's special guards, they were pretty much the only people who benefitted and received special treatment from Commodus' tyrannical reign, and they were reluctant to give up their exorbitant privileges. One day, hundreds of Praetorian guards rushed to the gates of the palace in anger at their reduced pay; no one made any attempt to stop them -- except the emperor himself. On news of their approach, Pertinax walked out to meet them; admonishing them for their treachery and greed. For a few moments it actually worked, and they were ashamed of what they were doing, and in awe of the bravery and nobility of the emperor. But then, one of the guards snapped them out of their stupor and struck Pertinax, causing a cascade of wounds, until finally they cut off his head, stuck it on a lance, and marched it triumphantly to their camp, while the Roman populace, who loved their short-termed emperor, looked on with sad indignation.

Sulpicianus, The governor of Rome, upon hearing this mutiny, rode out to meet them and plead with them to restore their loyalty to Rome. Then, in one of the strangest twists of history I've ever read, this happened:

> He [Sulpicianus] had already begun to use the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial dignity; but the more prudent of the Praetorians, apprehensive that, in this private contract, they should not obtain a just price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts; and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be disposed of to the best bidder by public auction. This infamous offer, the most insolent excess of military licence, diffused an universal grief, shame, and indignation throughout the city.

The buyer ended up being a wealthy senator, Didius Julianus, who won the bid against Sulpicianus, and who was placed on the throne that night. After the excitement had died down and he was left alone, that very night Julianus seemed to almost immediately regret his actions:

> Yet it was observed, that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed, and left him to darkness, solitude, and terrible reflection, he passed a sleepless night; revolving most probably in his mind his own rash folly, the fate of his virtuous predecessor, and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire, which had not been acquired by merit, but purchased by money.

Three generals of Rome, after hearing about this, left their encampments throughout the empire to race for the claim to the cheaply bought throne (and with the stated goal of avenging Pertinax). It ended with Septimus Severus, one of the generals, getting there first, easily deposing Julianus (the Praetorian guards weren't really loyal to him, and lacked discipline among themselves for the defense of the city), became the new emperor. His policies and reforms further set the stage for the decline of Rome, but the sale by the Praetorian guards were really, according to Gibbon, the first stirrings of it. The beginning of Pertinax's reign to Severus taking the throne, all happened in one year, known as the _Year of the Five Emperors_.

The empire that nearly owned the world, could be bought and sold _at public auction_ by its ancient version of a secret service. And this, after a period of 200 years of unprecedented stability and happiness for the Romans. Stories like this make you wonder about the stability of our modern institutions and governments. History is stranger than fiction.
